# Hoobank - A React Website

This is a simple website made with React based on the ["Build and Deploy a Fully Responsive Website with Modern UI/UX in React JS with Tailwind" Tutorial](https://youtu.be/_oO4Qi5aVZs?si=7AzfpKJdqgNtBhGW) by [Javascript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery).

## What I Learned
I leveled up my React skills, really diving into how components work and understanding state and props management. Tailwind CSS was also new to me and brought a whole new dimension to my frontend game. Through repetition, I got comfortable with Tailwind utility classes and how they are used. Additionally, I learned more about its component and dynamic classes. 

Overall, this was a great starter project to get my feet wet with React and Tailwind CSS. I'm excited to keep building on these skills and creating more complex projects in the future.
